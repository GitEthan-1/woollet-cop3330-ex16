/**
 * Program 16 - Legal Driving Age
 * You can test for equality, but you may need to test to see how a number compares to a known value and display a message if the number is too low or too high.
 *
 * Write a program that asks the user for their age and compare it to the legal driving age of sixteen.
 * If the user is sixteen or older, then the program should display "You are old enough to legally drive." If the user is under sixteen,
 * the program should display "You are not old enough to legally drive."
 *
 * Example Output
 *
 * What is your age? 15
 * You are not old enough to legally drive.
 *
 * Or
 *
 * What is your age? 35
 * You are old enough to legally drive.
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 * Use a single output statement.
 * Use a ternary operator to write this program. If your language doesn’t support a ternary operator, use a regular if/else statement,
 * and still use a single output statement to display the message.
 *
 * Challenges
 *
 * If the user enters a number that’s less than zero or enters non-numeric data, display an error message that asks the user to enter a valid age.
 * Instead of hard-coding the driving age in your program logic, research driving ages for various countries and create a lookup table for the driving ages and countries.
 * Prompt for the age, and display which countries the user can legally drive in.
